# Hariseon Code Refactoring

## Description

The code of this webpage was refactored to improve accessibility and sustainability by incorporating semantic HTML elements, logical structure, adding accessible 'alt' attributes to images and icons. CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow HTML semantic elements.

This project emphasized the importance of accessibility standards. The content or functionality of the application were not altered but the changes made to the code aimed at improving search engine optimization.
